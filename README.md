General Purpose and Functionality of the App
The Babies app directs users to an information page based on the baby’s gender when they first access the interface.
The app provides details on the expected weight and height of babies month by month, the physical activities they can perform, and suggestions for spending time with babies.
I have also added a horoscope feature.
A daily section has been included, allowing users to add and save notes and photos.

I hope you like it. Thank you.

# babies_app
I am developing an application where mothers and expectant mothers can learn about their baby's development, check their horoscopes, take daily notes, and add photos. There are still features I want to add and improvements I want to make.
